# What-is-egg-freezing-and-when-should-women-consider-it-

Egg freezing is when a womanâ€™s eggs are collected, frozen, and stored for future use. It gives women the chance to delay pregnancy without losing egg quality. As women age, their egg quality drops, especially after 35. Freezing them earlier can help plan pregnancy later with fewer problems.

Women should consider egg freezing if:

They are not ready for kids now

Want to focus on career or personal life

Facing health issues like cancer

Havenâ€™t found the right partner

Have family history of early menopause

The process involves 10â€“12 days of hormone injections to grow multiple eggs, then a small procedure to collect them under anesthesia. After that, the eggs are frozen using a method called vitrification.

Itâ€™s safe and becoming more popular among women in their late 20s and early 30s. Clinics like Trinity IVF offer fertility testing before starting to check if egg freezing is right for you.
